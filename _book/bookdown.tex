This online book is a compilation of resources aimed at advancing
quantitative social science in Singapore. It is meant to be a `living
document', so it will be updated as frequently as possible. The main
goal is to promote interest, rigour, and transparency in trying to
understand Singapore society through quantitative lenses. It does so by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Providing information on Singapore-relevant datasets} that are
  currently used to answer research and policy questions (Chapter
  \ref{publicdata} and Chapter \ref{restricteddata}). This includes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Descriptions of \emph{publicly available} datasets and how to access
    them. This overview of the `data landscape' will be helpful for
    social scientists to get started with research on Singapore, and
    prevent wasteful overlap in primary data collection across
    institutions.
  \item
    A list of \emph{restricted} or \emph{non-publicly available}
    datasets that could be used to answer important research or policy
    questions if access was granted. If available, details on the
    dataset and reasons for data restriction will also be listed. It is
    hoped that this list will promote greater transparency in data
    sharing across research teams.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Occasional think pieces by researchers} on best practices and
  on how to improve quantitative social science in Singapore (Chapter
  \ref{think}).
\item
  \textbf{Maintaining a repository of replicable case studies on
  Singapore society} (with annotated code, where possible) which can be
  used for illustrations in any quantitatively oriented college-level
  class (Chapter \ref{oop} onwards). These may be short summaries
  (blog-length) of published work, or side analyses that may not be
  appropriate for an academic journal but are useful for Singapore
  social science nonetheless.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{I am actively looking for contributors} (go

see how you can contribute). Readers with ideas on how to improve this
resource (or who may wish to help me maintain it) may use the in-built

\section*{Why I started this project}\label{why-i-started-this-project}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Why I started this project}

Quantitative research is not (and should not be) the only approach we
take to understanding Singapore society, but constant appeals to ``big
data''\footnote{See, for instance,
  \url{https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/business-big-data-singapore-has-built-cutting-edge}}
or claims of ``evidence-based policy''\footnote{Government agencies such
  as the Ministry of Social and Family Development often
  \href{https://www.msf.gov.sg/about-MSF/our-people/Divisions-at-MSF/Family-Development-and-Support/Pages/default.aspx}{use
  such a phrase.}} makes it ever more important for members of the
public to \textbf{critically evaluate the use of numbers} in making
arguments or in representations of social phenomena.

Educational institutions have an important role to play in this
``data-driven'' world. Every year, undergraduates studying the social
sciences in our local universities take several courses in research
methods to fulfil the requirements of their degrees. Part of this
research methods sequence typically involves training in introductory
statistics or ``quantitative reasoning''. Quantitative courses in social
science departments differ from those taught in the natural sciences
because they are thought to be more applied - the focus is on the use of
statistical methods to answer questions about society. Understanding and
applying these methods \textbf{to the Singapore context} is crucial here
- at this point, students learn about (and hopefully are inspired by)
the kind of questions they can ask about the very society they live in,
given the quantitative tools they are learning.

However, my first exposure to statistics as an undergraduate reading
Sociology at NUS\footnote{(the) National University of Singapore} was to
textbooks containing examples from only Western societies
\citep[e.g.,][]{agresti_statistical_2009, treiman_quantitative_2009}.
While the use of these internationally-recognized textbooks may provide
some assurance of quality education, sole reliance on foreign material
often becomes a missed opportunity to inspire students to build on and
improve Singapore social science. Without contextualization\footnote{Notwithstanding
  the terribly unhelpful stereotype of social science students being
  ``good at writing but bad at numbers''.}, abstract statistical
concepts (e.g., hypotheses testing, chi-squared tests) seem removed from
everyday experience, and impede the ability to take these important
concepts beyond the classroom and into public dialogue.

I started this book with the view to use it primarily \emph{as a
teaching tool}\footnote{For instance, the public repository of
  Singapore-oriented examples and illustrations may be used to
  supplement courses based on textbooks written by international
  scholars.}, but it can be used in many other ways. In the long term, I
hope that resources in this book will encourage quantitative literacy
and research in Singapore by making it easier for interested parties to
browse, use, and understand Singapore-relevant data. Social science
researchers may use the dataset listings as a springboard for
collaboration, or contribute their own interesting case studies for the
benefit of the Singapore public. Others (such as journalists, civil
servants, or non-profit organizations) may find value in these material
as a gateway to quantitative research on Singapore society, and how to
think carefully about pertinent issues surrounding such work.

\textbf{\emph{For Singapore social science.}}

\section*{How to contribute}\label{how-to-contribute}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{How to contribute}

\textbf{To list a dataset}

I will progressively list any Singapore-related dataset that I know of,
but my knowledge is far from exhaustive. To help me out, you can simply
alert me to an unlisted dataset and let me know where to find
information on it (and I will write it up). However, if you could do the
following and send it to me, it would make my task much easier:

Write a short paragraph on the dataset which includes (but is not
limited to) the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Basic details about the dataset (name, how was data collected, how
  many observations etc.)
\item
  Name(s) of the Principal Investigator(s) (and links to their
  webpage/profiles, if possible)
\item
  How to access the dataset (e.g., a website that allows a direct
  download or lists instructions to obtain the data)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Publicly available} datasets are basically datasets that can be
downloaded freely or for which access can obtained through a simple
procedure (e.g., signing up for an online account, sending a form with a
simple research topic). \emph{Restricted} or \emph{Non-publicly
available} datasets are those that require more extensive clearance
(e.g., a background check, use of a data enclave) to access. Data for
which there is no information on access also fall under this criteria.
Email me at
\href{mailto:shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}}
to list a dataset.

\textbf{To write a think piece}

Think pieces can be of any length (suggested length is 500-2000 words)
and on any topic related to quantitative social science. For instance,
pieces may comment on the state of quantitative social science in
Singapore (e.g., what is lacking, how we can do better) and/or provide
tips for social scientists seeking to study Singapore (e.g., how to
write grant applications, where to find data). That said, I am still
mulling over whether this should be an invite-only section, or have
pieces go through some kind of review mechanism (I do not wish to be the
sole arbiter of what goes up here). Nevertheless, email me at
\href{mailto:shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}}
if you think you can contribute a think piece (or have someone to
suggest).

\textbf{To contribute a case study}

Case studies are meant to illustrate a point about Singapore as a
society or quantitative methods in general. These may include
blog-length summaries of published research, or smaller side analyses
that are useful for Singapore social science. I am hoping that most of
these case studies include some form of data analysis, and/or relate a
useful (quantitative) concept to the Singapore context. Replicable case
studies are preferred (i.e., anyone familiar with some code\footnote{Code
  can be in any language - R, Stata, Python, SAS, Mplus etc.} can
reproduce results), but researchers unable to share code (and data)
should not disqualify themselves from contributing. Further, this online
book is written using the Rmarkdown language, so it would be helpful if
contributors are familiar with it - but this is not a prerequisite.
Email me at
\href{mailto:shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}}
if you have an idea for a case study, and we can work together to make
it happen.

\part{Datasets for Social
Science}\label{part-datasets-for-social-science}

\chapter{Public Data}\label{publicdata}

This section contains a list of public datasets available for social
scientists to analyze. Datasets should be in disaggregated form in a way
that is useful for academic work\footnote{In essence, academics should
  be able to publish from it.} and social research. For each one, a
brief description of the dataset, the investigators, and details for
access will be included. It is expected that this list will continue to
grow.

Aggregated administrative data, like those that can be found on
\url{https://data.gov.sg} or from government reports, are not really the
focus here. \emph{However}, information about data that can be linked to
disaggregated datasets (e.g., data on neighbourhood characteristics, or
other forms of contextual data) to improve analyses are welcomed.

Readers who believe I have provided wrong information on any of these
datasets can contact me, so that I can correct it. Use the in-built
annotation feature, or send me an email at
\href{mailto:shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}}
if you know about a dataset that should be featured in this list but is
not included here.

\section{Asian Barometer Survey (ABS)}\label{abs}

The Asian Barometer Survey is a cross-country, longitudinal study
(repeated cross-section) of public opinion in about 21 countries. Data
was collected through face-to-face interviews with adults aged 21 and
above. The survey assesses opinions on issues such as political values,
democracy, governance, human security, and economic reform. Singapore
has participated in 3 out of 4 waves of data collection - 2006 (N=1012),
2010 (N=1000), and 2014 (N=1039).

ABS is coordinated by the
\href{http://www.asianbarometer.org/structure}{Hu Fu Center for East
Asia Democratic Studies} at the National Taiwan University.

Instructions for data access can be found at
\url{http://www.asianbarometer.org/data/data-release}.

\section{IPS Public Data}\label{ips}

The IPS Public Data Sharing Platform is not a single dataset, but a
repository that houses data collected by the Institute of Policy Studies
at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (NUS). These data range from
surveys on political information, perceptions of policies, to food
prices by neighbourhood districts. The available datasets are listed
below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Survey on Political Traits and Media Use
\item
  Impact of New Media on General Election 2011
\item
  POPS (6): Perceptions of Singles on Marriage and Having Children
\item
  POPS (7): Perceptions of the Marriage \& Parenthood Package (2013)
\item
  IPS Study on Perceptions of Singapore's history
\item
  POPS (8): IPS Post-Election Survey 2015
\item
  Perceptions of Governance Survey
\item
  Internet and Media Use During GE2015
\item
  The Makan Index -- A Survey of Hawker Food Prices
\item
  Makan Index 2017: An indicator for Cost of Eating Out in Singapore
\end{enumerate}

More information on these datasets and instructions for data access can
be found at
\url{https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips/research/surveys/public-data-sharing-platform}.

\section{Panel on Health and Ageing of Singaporean Elderly
(PHASE)}\label{phase}

The Panel on Health and Ageing of Singaporean Elderly is a longitudinal
panel study that tracks changes in the physical, social and mental
health of Singapore residents. Respondents are aged 60 years and above
in 2009, and three waves of data collection have been conducted so far.
Wave 1 was conducted in 2009 (N=4990), Wave 2 in 2011 (N=3103), and Wave
3 in 2015 (N=1572).

PHASE includes data on physical health, mental health, social engagement
(e.g., loneliness, social participation, social networks), income,
employment, and housing. Anthropometric and performance measurements,
including blood pressure, sitting and standing height, waist
circumference, body weight and hand grip strength, were also conducted.

Principal Investigators for PHASE are Associate Professor
\href{https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/hssr/our-team/faculty/faculty-staff-details/Detail/13200}{Angelique
Chan}, Professor
\href{https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/hssr/our-team/faculty/faculty-staff-details/Detail/31920}{David
Matchar}, and Assistant Professor
\href{https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/hssr/our-team/faculty/faculty-staff-details/Detail/30743}{Rahul
Malhotra} at Duke-NUS Medical School.

Instructions for data access can be found at
\url{https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/care/research/dataset-codebook}.

\section{World Values Survey (WVS)}\label{wvs}

The World Values Survey is a global study to help social scientists
understand changes in the beliefs, values and motivations of people
across multiple countries. To date, there have been 7 waves of data
collection (repeated cross-section, not panel) from almost 100
countries. The survey includes questions on societal trust, religion,
work, security, and politics. Singapore participated in Wave 4 (2002,
N=1512) and Wave 6 (2012, N=1972). Principal Investigators are Associate
Professor \href{http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/soctanes/}{Tan Ern Ser}
at NUS (2002), and Associate Professor
\href{https://www.suss.edu.sg/about-suss/faculty-and-staff/detail/vincent-chua}{Vincent
CH Chua} at SUSS (2012).

Data can be accessed at \url{http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org}.

\chapter{Restricted Data}\label{restricteddata}

This section contains a list of datasets that are potentially useful for
social scientists to analyze, but for which access is restricted. The
focus here is not on small studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials
for a small subset of the population), but on large datasets that can be
of use to social scientists across disciplines.

Other than a description of the data (as far as possible), this section
will also include information on how restrictions may be lifted (i.e.,
how to gain access), if possible. It is hoped that listing them here
will promote transparency in data sharing across research teams, and
eventually prevent wasteful overlap in primary data collection across
institutions. As in the public data section, disaggregated data that can
be used for research is the focus here.

Readers who believe I have wrongly listed a dataset here (i.e., they are
not restricted), or have more accurate information than provided, can
contact me. Use the in-built annotation feature, or send me an email at
\href{mailto:shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg}}
if you know about a dataset that should be featured in this list but is
not included here.

\section{Department of Statistics (DOS) Microdata}\label{dos}

The Singapore \href{https://www.singstat.gov.sg}{Department of
Statistics (DOS)} regularly conducts a number of surveys that, if access
to disaggregated data were provided, could advance Singapore social
science greatly. These include the Household Expenditure Survey, the
General Household Survey, as well as records from the Registry of
Marriages to track marriage and divorce trends in Singapore.
Disaggregated data (i.e., microdata) allow for deeper analysis than what
is presented in the public domain - for instance, social scientists may
examine age-period-cohort trends in marriage and divorce rather than be
confined solely to period statistics (which may be misleading), or to
decompose within- and between- group variance in household
income/expenditures for a better understanding of inequality in
Singapore.

Unfortunately, the DOS does not share disaggregated data with
researchers. When asked, the chatbot on the DOS website states:

\begin{quote}
The Department of Statistics (DOS) is unable to provide access to raw
data or anonymised microdata in the public domain. You may wish to refer
to our publications on the surveys conducted for the latest survey data.
If the required aggregated data is not available in the reports, you
could provide us with the table formats. Please send them to
\href{mailto:info@singstat.gov.sg}{\nolinkurl{info@singstat.gov.sg}}. We
will assess the availability of the data and, if customised and
aggregated data generation is required, we will let you know the
applicable cost-recovery fees.
\end{quote}

Further, under section 7 of the
\href{https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SA1973}{Statistics Act}, ``anonymised
microdata'' (i.e., disaggregated data) obtained using the powers of the
Act (i.e., where individuals are legally compelled to provide
information) can only be shared with other public agencies, or ``any
consultant commissioned by a public agency''. This means that social
scientists outside of the government can only access these data by being
appointed as a consultant by a public agency, unless the Statistics Act
is amended to include other classes of persons\footnote{According to
  Section 7(2)(b)(ii), such classes may be specified in the Third
  Schedule.}.

\section{National Youth Survey (NYS)}\label{nys}

The NYS is a cross-sectional survey of youth in Singapore that is
conducted every three to five years. Its goal is to understand the
aspirations, challenges, and attitudes of young Singaporeans aged 15-34.
The survey has been conducted five times thus far, in 2002, 2005, 2010,
2013 (N=2,843), and 2016 (N=3,531).

NYS is administered by the National Youth Council (NYC)'s research team.
More detail can be found at the NYC website -
\url{https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en/initiatives/resources/national-youth-survey/}
- which hosts illustrated PDF summaries of the survey findings from
selected years. It does not list any plans to make the dataset publicly
available.

\section{Retirement and Health Study (RHS)}\label{rhs}

The RHS is a longitudinal survey of Singapore residents' retirement and
healthcare needs and how they change over time. It is conducted by the
Central Provident Fund Board (CPF). This is a panel study of individuals
aged 45 to 85 in 2014, with the same individuals being interviewed once
every two years (for ten years, beginning in 2014). The survey includes
information on household expenses, employment, health, and financial
status. This is a large study with potentially many uses - RHS purports
to have reached out to more than 23,000 participants in the first two
rounds of interviews\footnote{\url{https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/RHS_FAQ_Booklet.pdf}}.

More information is available at
\url{https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Others/member-pages/retirement-and-health-study-(rhs)}.
The RHS website does not list any plans to make the dataset publicly
available, and is accessible only to government agencies or researchers
working with/for government agencies. The RHS study team can be reached
at \href{mailto:cpf_rhs@cpf.gov.sg}{\nolinkurl{cpf\_rhs@cpf.gov.sg}}.

\section{Singapore Life Panel (SLP)}\label{slp}

The Singapore Life Panel administers an internet-based monthly survey to
approximately 11,000 Singaporeans aged 50 to 70 years. Information on
income, expenditure, health, work and housing choices are solicited from
panel members. The panel survey is one of the largest
population-representative monthly surveys conducted in the world. This
study is unique in Singapore because of the monthly frequency of surveys
- the sheer amount of data collected over time is unprecedented.

The Singapore Life Panel is housed at the
\href{https://crea.smu.edu.sg/singapore-monthly-panel}{Centre for
Research on the Economics of Ageing} at SMU. The SLP website does not
list any plans to make the dataset publicly available outside of their
own research team. The SLP team can be reached at
\href{mailto:crea@smu.edu.sg}{\nolinkurl{crea@smu.edu.sg}}.

\section{Singapore Panel Study on Social Dynamics (SPSSD)}\label{spssd}

The Singapore Panel Study on Social Dynamics was started in 2014 to
understand challenges related to family cohesion and functioning. It is
a longitudinal panel study, starting with 5002 heads of households
interviewed in 2014. Its purpose is to measure family dynamics, societal
values and attitudes relevant to national identity and social mobility
over time. Waves 1 to 4 of data collection have been completed\footnote{See
  some basic descriptives here:
  \url{https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/ips/2018-07-11_spssd-wave2_english.pdf}},
with Wave 5 beginning in 2019. A strength of this study is its panel
data - few Singapore datasets with rich data on family dynamics have
this many waves collected from the same individuals over time.

The Principal Investigator for this study is Dr
\href{https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/our-people/faculty/natalie-pang}{Natalie
Pang} at the Institute of Policy Studies, NUS. The SPSSD website does
not list any plans to make the dataset publicly available, probably
because of restrictions imposed by government funders. The SPSSD study

\section{Youth Survey on Transitions and Evolving Pathways in Singapore
(Youth
STEPS)}\label{youth-survey-on-transitions-and-evolving-pathways-in-singapore-youth-steps}

Youth STEPS is a six-year longitudinal survey of Singaporean youth aged
17 to 24 that began in 2017 (N=4,041). It covers a wide range of topics,
including respondents' educational and career trajectories, family
relationships, civic participation, and attitudes regarding social
mobility, family, marriage, and more. The survey is in its third wave
(as of 2019) and is scheduled to be completed in 2022.

Youth STEPS is funded by the National Youth Council and administered by
the Institute of Policy Studies (Social Lab), part of the Lee Kuan Yew
School of Public Policy. The Principal Investigator is Dr
\href{http://lkyspp.splashinteractive.sg/ips/about-us/staff-directory/leong-chan-hoong}{Leong

\chapter{Blown out of proportion}\label{oop}

\begin{verbatim}
Contributor: Shannon Ang
Date: 21 May 2019
\end{verbatim}

Proportions (sometimes expressed in percentages) are commonly used in
popular media to reflect public opinion. In fact, it is often the only
type of statistic we get\footnote{Reports such as those released in the
  form of IPS working papers, sometimes include multivariable analysis,
  but often after many pages of crosstabulations} to evaluate as
``evidence''. For instance, a news article may state that ``nearly 46
per cent of those aged 18 to 25 would allow extremist views that deem
all other religions as enemies to be published''\footnote{\url{https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/nearly-1-2-young-sporeans-open-extremist-views-being-posted-online-survey-shows}},
or that ``59 per cent of Chinese find a Malay president
acceptable''\footnote{\url{https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/majority-willing-to-accept-president-or-pm-of-another-race-but-prefer-one-of-their-own}}.
While these proportions are easy for the general public to understand,
they can be misleading if not read carefully. This case study looks at
two different news articles, showing how some claims can be exaggerated
by careless use of numbers.

\section{Media claim 1: Support for the Watain ban}\label{watain}

Swedish black metal band Watain was supposed to perform in Singapore on
7 March 2019. However, the gig was cancelled just hours before it was
scheduled to begin, with the government citing concerns from the
Christian community\footnote{See
  \url{https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/watain-concert-cancelled-christian-community-reaction-shanmugam-11399434}}.
To evaluate public sentiment towards this incident, REACH\footnote{The
  Singapore Government's feedback unit} conducted a poll with 680
Singaporeans aged 15 and above. Of interest here is how results from
this poll was represented in public discourse.

\begin{quote}
Our assessment of public sentiment turned out to be correct, because a
subsequent REACH survey showed that, first of all, that 60\% were aware
of the cancellation. \textbf{Of those who were aware}, 86\% of
Christians agreed with the cancellation. That I think will be natural.
But 64\% \textbf{of all who had heard about the cancellation}, Christian
and non-Christian, also agreed with the cancellation. Twenty-eight
percent thought that it should not have been cancelled.

Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam, 1 April 2019, emphasis mine
\end{quote}

The quote above is
\href{https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=ministerial-statement-1170}{taken
directly from the Hansard}, and is consistent with the results shown in
REACH's
\href{https://www.reach.gov.sg/~/media/2019/press-release/findings-of-poll-on-watain-concert--1-april-2019.pdf}{press
release}. Note the phrases that I bolded for our purposes, which I will
call ``qualifiers''.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/proportion/STwatain} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of online article on results from REACH poll. Retrieved May 21, 2019.}\label{fig:st-watain}
\end{figure}

The next day, national newspaper The Straits Times ran
\href{https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapolitics/parliament-two-out-of-three-singaporeans-back-governments-move-to-cancel}{a
story} headlined ``Parliament: Two in three back move to ban Watain
gig''. Within the text of the article, it reads:

\begin{quote}
The Government decided to cancel the permit for Watain's concert last
month when it received reports that mainstream Christians were very
concerned and offended by the band, Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam
said yesterday. \textbf{And a survey of Singaporeans by government
feedback unit Reach found that two in three supported the move, he
noted.} Among Christians, 86 per cent were supportive of the move to
disallow the concert, the Reach poll found.
\end{quote}

Note the qualifier ``among those who were aware'' is neither in the
headline (Figure \ref{fig:st-watain}) nor the body of the
article\footnote{CNA ran a similar headline, but included the qualifier
  within the article. See
  \url{https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/2-in-3-singaporeans-in-reach-poll-supported-government-s-11401066}}.
\emph{Why is this important?}
\href{https://www.reach.gov.sg/~/media/2019/press-release/findings-of-poll-on-watain-concert--1-april-2019.pdf}{Results
from REACH} show that 63\% of respondents were aware, and \emph{out of
these respondents}, 64\% supported the government's ban. This means that
out of \emph{all} respondents to the survey, only about 40\% reported
supporting the ban. The qualifying phrase ``among those who were aware''
meaningfully changes the interpretation of the results - we shouldn't be
able to say that \textbf{the majority of Singaporeans} supported the ban
when in fact only 40\% of the survey respondents did so.

In effect, the Straits Times article is invoking a strong assumption
here (see \ref{ooptech} for a more technical explanation) - that
\emph{if} those who were unaware were in fact able to express their
support for the ban, the same proportion of respondents (among those who
were aware, 64\%) would also support the ban. But being aware of the ban
is a \emph{prerequisite} for support of the ban, which makes this
assumption rather unreasonable. Even assuming this hypothetical scenario
were possible, the actual figure could be higher or lower - it depends
on how similar (or different) the unaware are to the aware. Those who
were not aware may be less likely to care about black metal music (or
simply too busy to keep up with current affairs) and simply base their
support of the ban on their general sentiment toward government
policies. This seemingly minor omission of the qualifier can lead to
false conclusions pretty quickly. Let us look at another example.

\section{Media claim 2: Web-savvy Seniors}\label{websavvy}

Part of my research involves looking at how Internet use can improve the
lives of older adults \citep[see][]{ang_going_2018}. I was interested in
what the overall situation was like in Singapore, and googled something
like ``internet use seniors''. One 2014 article in the Straits Times
immediately caught my eye (see Figure \ref{fig:st-websavvyseniors}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/proportion/STwebsavvyseniors} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of online article on web-savvy seniors. Retrieved May 21, 2019.}\label{fig:st-websavvyseniors}
\end{figure}

Within the article, the reporter states:

\begin{quote}
Also, \textbf{78 per cent of those aged 55 and older here access the
Internet every day} either via the traditional Web browser or smartphone
apps, putting Singapore fifth in the world for having the most
Internet-savvy seniors.
\end{quote}

I was skeptical. Over and above my anecdotal experience with Singapore
older adults, past research in the United States\footnote{For instance,
  see
  \url{https://www.pewinternet.org/2012/06/06/older-adults-and-internet-use/}}
gave me reason to expect that the proportion of older people even using
the Internet (everyday or not) should be much lower. Some results from
Consumer Barometer are available online, so we can
\href{https://www.consumerbarometer.com/en/trending/?countryCode=SG\&category=TRN-AGE-55-PLUS}{check
for ourselves}. Of interest in Figure \ref{fig:cb-seniorsinternet} are
numbers reflecting internet use in year 2014, which is when the news
article was published. Note that the percent of Singaporeans aged 55 and
above who use the internet daily in 2014 \textbf{is 29\%, not 78\% as
the article suggests.}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/proportion/CBseniorsinternet} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of Consumer Barometer findings across time. Retrieved May 21, 2019.}\label{fig:cb-seniorsinternet}
\end{figure}

How then, did the reporter get things so wrong? While detailed
statistics for 2014 doesn't seem available online anymore, a little
investigation using 2017 figures shows how the reporter arrived at a
number as high as 78\%.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/proportion/CBsinglequestion} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of Consumer Barometer results on 2017 internet use. Retrieved May 21, 2019.}\label{fig:cb-single}
\end{figure}

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:cb-single}, the crucial part is the footnote
that says ``base'', which tells us that the 82\% figure for daily
Internet usage in 2017 are \textbf{among those who use the internet}. We
can easily calculate this 82\% with the numbers in Figure
\ref{fig:cb-seniorsinternet} - note that 43\footnote{The percent of
  Singapore residents aged 55+ using the internet in 2017, from Figure
  \ref{fig:cb-seniorsinternet}} is approximately 82\% of 53\footnote{The
  percent of Singapore residents aged 55+ using the internet
  \emph{daily} in 2017, from Figure \ref{fig:cb-seniorsinternet}}. That
is, \(\frac{43}{53} \approx 0.82\). This recovers the 82\% figure that
we see in Figure \ref{fig:cb-single}.

Using the same strategy, we can recover the reporter's figure for 2014:
\(\frac{29}{37} \approx 0.78\).

\emph{What does this mean?} This means that just like the reporter in
the Watain example (\ref{watain}), this reporter left out an important
qualifier - only 29\% of all older adults in Singapore use the internet
daily, but 78\% \textbf{of those who use the internet} use it daily.
This vast discrepancy is highly consequential - the statement that ``78
per cent of those aged 55 and older here access the Internet every day''
is false, and the headline that ``Majority of Singapore seniors are Web
savvy'' is misleading at best.

\section{Technical excursus}\label{ooptech}

Before we go into a more technical explanation of what went wrong in
these two cases, let us first move from proportions to probabilities.
The difference between a proportion and a probability is important here.
Note that when Minister Shanmugam asserted the REACH poll provided
evidence that the Government's ``assessment of public sentiment turned
out to be correct'', he was not suggesting that 680 Singaporeans form
the whole Singapore public. The underlying assumption was that since
most survey respondents (who were aware) supported the ban, it is likely
that most Singaporeans (who are aware) will also support the ban. That
is, he was using the \emph{proportion} of supportive survey respondents
(a description of the sample), to infer the \emph{probability} (a
hypothetical quantity) of any one Singaporean supporting the ban.

The difference between a probability and a proportion may be simplified
using a coin flip example. If I flip a fair coin 4 times, the proportion
of heads may be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1. However, since it is a fair
coin, the probability of getting a heads is, by definition, 0.5. So the
proportion may or may not equal the probability. What we know is that
the more times I flip the coin, the more likely the proportion of heads
will reflect the true probability of getting a heads. It is thus common
to hear people say that the probability is the ``long-run proportion of
an event''. Below is some code (in R) for you to try out the coin flip
example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Set the number of trials to 4. }
\CommentTok{# You may change the number to see what happens.}
\NormalTok{n <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4} 
\CommentTok{# Get the proportion of heads after flipping a fair coin n times. }
\CommentTok{# Try this a few times.}
\KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{rbinom}\NormalTok{(n, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{prob=}\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{))}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{n }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We have now established that the main reason why we are interested in
proportions from a REACH poll is because they purport to tell us
something about Singaporeans in general. That is, the REACH poll
suggests that if we were to randomly pick a Singaporean from those who
are aware of the ban, the probability of this person supporting the ban
is about 0.64 (or 64\%). The problem at hand then reduces to a trivial
probability question, assuming that we all remember basic probability
rules from secondary (primary?) school\footnote{Or that we can Google it
  if not}. If the REACH poll is indeed representative of all
Singaporeans, then we have the following quantities:

 \[
\begin{aligned}
&\Pr(\text{Aware of Ban}) = 0.63 \\
&\Pr(\text{Not Aware of Ban}) = 1 - \Pr(\text{Aware of Ban}) = 0.37 \\
&\Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Aware of Ban}) = 0.64 
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Aware of Ban})\) is a conditional
probability, but the quantity that is being asserted in the news article
is \(\Pr(\text{Support Ban})\), which is the total probability. Using
the law of total probability, we know that:

 \[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(\text{Support Ban}) &= \Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Aware of Ban})\cdot \Pr(\text{Aware of Ban}) \\
& \quad + \Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Not Aware of Ban})\cdot \Pr(\text{Not Aware of Ban}) 
\end{aligned}
\]

Plugging in the numbers that we have,

 \[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(\text{Support Ban}) &= 0.64 \cdot 0.63 + \Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Not Aware of Ban}) \cdot 0.37 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

we see that \(\Pr(\text{Support Ban}) = 0.64\) if and only if
\(\Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Not Aware of Ban})\) also equals
\(0.64\). That said,
\(\Pr(\text{Support Ban } | \text{ Not Aware of Ban})\) is logically
impossible, and should equal zero. Similarly, for the Web-savvy Seniors
example,

 \[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(\text{Use Internet Daily}) &= \Pr(\text{Use Internet Daily } | \text{ Use Internet})\cdot \Pr(\text{Use Internet}) \\
& \quad + \Pr(\text{Use Internet Daily } | \text{ Don't Use Internet})\cdot \Pr(\text{Don't Use Internet}) \\
&= 0.78 \cdot 0.37 + \Pr(\text{Use Internet Daily } | \text{ Don't Use Internet})\cdot 0.63 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\Pr(\text{Use Internet Daily } | \text{ Don't Use Internet})\)
is impossible and should be zero. In both cases, total probabilites are
substantially different from the conditional probabilities, and there is
no reason to believe they would be the same.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

By now, it should be clear that qualifiers attached to proportions (and
percentages) are critical. Without them, results from studies can be
blown out of proportion. It is not wise to completely rely on assertions
made by news articles (or other kinds of reports), even from supposedly
credible agencies like the Straits Times. As we have seen, social
scientists should be comfortable with interpreting data from its
source\footnote{This, however, first requires data to be made available
  for replication purposes.} in order to evaluate claims that are being
made in public discourse today.

\chapter{Are we lonely?}\label{lonely}

\begin{verbatim}
Contributor: Shannon Ang
Date: 25 May 2019
\end{verbatim}

In population health research, there are a number of commonly used
scales to measure psychosocial well-being. For instance, the
\href{https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/depression-scale}{Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale} (CES-D) is widely used to
measure depression, and the
\href{https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/}{EQ-5D}\footnote{There's no
  `full' name for this, its just referred to as the EQ-5D.} to measure
quality of life. These scales seldom have an intuitive interpretation -
who knows what 10 points on the CES-D scale actually means in `real
life', versus 12 points? To address this, social scientists often choose
a ``cut-off'' point to simplify the measure into two categories (e.g.,
either you are depressed, or you are not). Some of these cut-off points
are well researched (such the cut-off point for mild cognitive
impairment), while others are more arbitrary.

This case study looks at the prevalence of loneliness in Singapore older
adults, and how these cut-offs can shape the way we think about it. The
focus here is \emph{not} to criticize researchers' choices of cut-off
points. Instead, this case study seeks to provide a way to evaluate
claims that are based on these cut-offs, so that we understand how to
compare claims across studies and/or reports.

\section{The lonely dichotomy}\label{the-lonely-dichotomy}

Loneliness is a real issue for many people today, and it has been shown
to have deleterious effects on health
\citep{rico-uribe_association_2018}. More of us are beginning to realize
that social connections are key, especially for older persons. The
Straits Times carried an
\href{https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/living-with-family-but-still-feeling-lonely}{article}
in 2018, with the headline ``Senior citizens living with family, but
still feeling lonely''.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/loneliness/livingarr} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of online article on lonely seniors. Retrieved May 25, 2019.}\label{fig:st-lonely}
\end{figure}

But what does \textbf{feeling lonely} really mean? There seems to be a
dichotomy being drawn here - either you feel lonely, or you don't feel
lonely. There is little room for nuance like ``I feel lonely when I ride
the bus by myself''. Of course, some level of simplification is needed
to compare across groups - and this simplification is what we need to
examine.

The news article highlights studies on loneliness (in Singapore) done by
two different groups - a team at the National Healthcare Group (NHG),
and a team at the Centre for Ageing Research and Education (CARE) in
Duke-NUS Medical School\footnote{Led by Associate Professor
  \href{https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/hssr/our-team/faculty/faculty-staff-details/Detail/13200}{Angelique
  Chan}}. As we will see, this lonely/not lonely dichotomy is drawn by
reseachers as well, but sometimes \textbf{in completely different ways}.
Let us take a closer look.

\section{Lonely by whose standard}\label{lonely-by-whose-standard}

The studies of interest\footnote{All these studies are open-access
  articles, anyone can access them even without a library subscription.}
here are \citet{wee_loneliness_2019}, \citet{ge_social_2017},
\citet{lim_association_2017}, and \citet{chan_loneliness_2015}. All of
these studies use a variant of the 3-item UCLA\footnote{University of
  California, Los Angeles} Loneliness Scale \citep{hughes_short_2004}.
The 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale consists of three questions, which all
of these studies use:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How often do you feel you lack companionship?
\item
  How often do you feel left out?
\item
  How often do you feel isolated from others?
\end{enumerate}

For each of the questions listed above, respondents were given a range
of responses to choose from. These are listed in Figure
\ref{fig:st-lonely-graph}. As you might notice, they were different
across the studies. \citet{wee_loneliness_2019} and
\citet{ge_social_2017} had only 3 response categories (the right
column), while \citet{lim_association_2017} and
\citet{chan_loneliness_2015} had 5 different response categories (the
left column). I put the point values for each response in parentheses.
In all of these studies, researchers added up these points across the 3
questions, and came up with their own `cut-off' point to determine who
was ``lonely''.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/loneliness/lonely_graph} 

}

\caption{Summary of response categories}\label{fig:st-lonely-graph}
\end{figure}

I added the \textbf{blue arrows} in Figure \ref{fig:st-lonely-graph} to
show how the 5 category option can be mapped to the 3 category option
(but not vice versa). We don't really know what kind of bias this will
introduce\footnote{For instance, one might argue that respondents might
  choose differently when given more gradational categories.}, but at
face value I think this looks pretty reasonable. Why am I doing this?
This ``matching'' allows us to do a little experiment with publicly
available data\footnote{So you can try it yourself} to answer the
following question: \textbf{How does changing the criteria change our
view of loneliness in Singapore?} The next section compares these
different coding schemes.

\section{Same data, different
results}\label{same-data-different-results}

For this simple analysis, I use data from Wave 2 of the Panel on Health
and Ageing of Singaporean Elderly (PHASE) (see \ref{phase}), conducted
in 2011. This is a nationally representative study of older adults aged
60 and above. It is essentially the same dataset used in
\citet{lim_association_2017} and \citet{chan_loneliness_2015}. Code
provided is in R. For the sake of brevity, I leave out observations with
any missing values on any of the loneliness items. A key concern of the
news article in Figure \ref{fig:st-lonely} is that even older adults
living with family members may be lonely, so we will look at a
cross-tabulation of living arrangements with ``loneliness''.

\textbf{Coding scheme 1: Lots of loneliness}

I first follow the coding scheme in \citet{lim_association_2017} and
\citet{chan_loneliness_2015}. I sum the items up (giving me a score that
ranges from 0-12), and then dichotomize respondents into people who are
``not lonely'' (score of 0), and those who are ``lonely'' (score of
1-12)\footnote{Note that \citet{chan_loneliness_2015} further splits the
  ``lonely'' group into ``sometimes lonely'' and ``mostly lonely''.
  \citet{lim_association_2017}, however, does not make this distinction.
  I have grouped them together since this is the way that it has usually
  been represented in public discourse (e.g., the claim that those who
  are lonely have a higher risk of mortality compared to those not
  lonely. See, for instance,
  \url{https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/those-who-feel-lonely-more-prone})}.
This cut-off point seems to have arisen from a ``common-sense'' approach
rather than any kind of formal testing - that is, group the people who
never experience loneliness in one group, and then put the rest who have
had some experience of loneliness in another.

 These numbers are indeed worrying. Older adults living alone are
understandably lonely, but those who live with their children (but
without their spouse) are not that far behind (50.1\%!). Even 28\% of
those who live with their spouse and child feel lonely, like the
headline in the news article (Figure \ref{fig:st-lonely}) suggests.

\textbf{Coding scheme 2: Not that much loneliness}

We then arrive at the coding scheme used by \citet{wee_loneliness_2019}
and \citet{ge_social_2017}. Summing the items gives me a score that
ranges from 3-9, and I then dichotomize the group into people who are
``not lonely'' (score of 3-5), and those who are ``lonely'' (score of
6-9). Note that these cut-points are probably arbitrary - while the
researchers cite a paper each to justify their use of the cut-point, the
cited papers do not really provide evidence in support of the cut-point.
The closest support for the cut-point in the cited papers that I could
discern is in \citet{steptoe_social_2013}, which states that they used
the top quintile\footnote{In their sample, not the Singapore one.} to
define loneliness. No reason was given as to why the top quintile was
chosen. Table \ref{tab:table-lonely2} shows the distribution of
``loneliness'' according to these criteria.

What you will immediately realize is that these numbers are way lower
than those when using coding scheme 1 (that is, the coding scheme of
\citet{lim_association_2017} and \citet{chan_loneliness_2015}). These
numbers are more consistent with the figures shown in
\citet{ge_social_2017}\footnote{Note that the sample in
  \citet{ge_social_2017} is of all adults aged 21 and older, not just
  older adults, so the higher number seen here is expected. Note also
  that in the paper, the authors show column percentages instead of row
  percentages. Since we are comparing across living arrangements
  however, row percentages are more appropriate.}. Further, the
difference in the proportion of those living alone and those living with
their child (but without their spouse) is similar in absolute terms, but
much larger in relative terms (see Table \ref{tab:table-lonely3}). While
the proportion of those lonely among those who live alone is 1.2 times
that of those living with only their children according to coding scheme
1, this ratio increases to 2 when using coding scheme 2. Based on these
results, it seems that the overall loneliness situation is much less
dire than before, and those who live with children don't seem as
isolated as those who live alone after all.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}

You may be thinking, so which way of conceptualizing loneliness is
``correct''? As I mentioned at the start of this case study, that is not
the goal here. The process of figuring out a useful cut-off point is a
long and tedious one that requires researchers to engage with each
other\footnote{And indeed, Singapore social science can perhaps use more
  of this.}. Rather, the goal here has been to highlight that decisions
like cut-off points may seem small, but are critical in the way we
interpret and talk about social phenomena. In this case study, these
cut-off points essentially define who is considered lonely. \textbf{If
these cut-off points are vastly different, we may not be even talking
about the same people} when we talk about ``lonely persons''. This means
that when comparing or drawing conclusions from the findings of
different studies, it is crucial that we understand the decisions that
produced the numbers.

\chapter{Size is not all that matters}\label{samples}

\begin{verbatim}
Contributor: Shannon Ang
Date: 22 July 2019
\end{verbatim}

In response to public surveys, it's quite common to hear people make
comments like ``they asked only 1000 people, how accurate can it be?''.
Of course, people tend to only say these things when the findings
presented are incongruent with their perception of reality.

This case study looks at whether and how size makes a difference when
we're trying to understand survey results from samples of the
population. My hope is for you (the reader) to realize that often,
\emph{how} the sample is drawn (and how we quantify uncertainty) is more
important than the size of the sample.

\section{But it's too small!}\label{sample-worklife}

We will first look at an example. Local newspaper The Straits Times
recently reported the findings of a
\href{https://www.michaelpage.com.sg/advice/career-advice/work-life-balance/singapore-happy-work}{study
done by Michael Page}, alleging that \textbf{8 of out 10 people are
``happy'' with their work-life balance}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/samples/st_worklife} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of online article on work-life balance. Retrieved July 16, 2019.}\label{fig:st-worklife}
\end{figure}

Many people on social media spoke out against the findings (not
unexpectedly), questioning how reliable these findings were. These
commentators probably felt such findings could not possibly reflect
reality, given their own experiences. Surely, they might believe, more
people are unhappy with their work-life balance. To rationalize this
incongruence, there will inadvertently be some attention drawn to the
sample size.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/samples/st_samplesize} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of comment on work-life balance article. Retrieved July 16, 2019.}\label{fig:st-samplesize}
\end{figure}

The comment above (Figure \ref{fig:st-samplesize}) shows how people
often rationalize their feelings toward studies that don't reflect their
own perception\footnote{For studies that do agree with the layperson's
  perception, one probable response would be that it is ``common sense''
  and that there is ``no need to do a study to know this''.}. How can
1328 survey respondents represent an entire population of approximately
5.9 million individuals?

The frustrating thing about the
\href{https://www.michaelpage.com.sg/advice/career-advice/work-life-balance/singapore-happy-work}{report
by Michael Page} is that it is \textbf{not transparent about its
methodology}. Without this information, we cannot know for sure about
how generalizable these findings are to the whole population. They
likely cannot say much about \emph{all Singaporeans} - the results may
be limited to Singaporeans who took the survey, who may be a very
different group of Singaporeans compared to those who did not take the
survey.

This is not an isolated case - it often is difficult to find out exactly
how surveys like these (that is, surveys aimed at generating public
interest and reported by the media) were conducted. As we will see, the
key questions are these: \textbf{How were respondents recruited, and how
is uncertainty being estimated?}

\section{Size matters, but how so?}\label{size-matters-but-how-so}

It is true that size matters. However, people tend to paint some variant
of this false dichotomy - results are accurate if the sample size is
arbitrarily large (e.g., \textasciitilde{}50k individuals, or some
percentage of the population size), and completely inaccurate otherwise.
But more data doesn't necessarily mean appropriate data. For instance,
having data on all Singaporean Chinese doesn't really help me understand
Singaporean Malays better. The dichotomy is also terribly unhelpful,
because what we want is to be able to draw big conclusions from small
data\footnote{The obsession with big data is sometimes misguided,
  especially if this suggests `small data' is useless or inferior. Big
  data is mostly useful for other reasons rather than its `bigness'
  (i.e., the sheer number of observations). See Matthew Salganik's
  subsection on this in his book \emph{Bit by Bit} for a good treatment
  of this subject:
  \url{https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/characteristics/big/}}.
In fact, we do this all the time - we conduct interviews to hire people,
we date others before entering into a serious relationship, we
administer written tests to measure area-specific knowledge, we audition
actors before casting them in a role, and more. While understanding that
these processes are not perfect, we do expect them to provide us with
sufficient information on which to base our bigger decisions.

\textbf{But how certain can we be?} This question is key. First, we need
the following information: what are the sampling probabilites for each
respondent in the sample? In other words, how likely is each member to
be selected into the sample? If they were selected at random\footnote{Random
  here means that every person in the population has an equal (or known)
  chance of being selected. It does not mean I randomly approach someone
  on the street, since certain types of people are more likely to be
  selected with this method (e.g., people who live close to that street,
  people who are around at that time, etc.). Usually, in Singapore,
  researchers who want a random sample get a list of household addresses
  from the Department of Statistics. It is assumed that the Department
  of Statistics provides a random sample of all household addresses, but
  I am not privy to what happens exactly.}, there are established
methods to calculate uncertainty around our findings\footnote{Via the
  Central Limit Theorem. If the quantity of interest is a
  proportion/probability, then the normal approximation property (and
  its assumptions) also needs to be invoked. The point here, however, is
  not to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem, but to demonstrate how
  sample size matters. I will therefore avoid getting into the
  technicalities of the Central Limit Theorem.}.

Let's do a small simulation exercise here to demonstrate how these
calculations work, without having to read the math\footnote{If you
  already understand what
  \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr\left[\frac{\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)}{\sigma} \leq x \right]= \Phi(x)\)
  means, you may skip ahead to the next section}. Code here is written
in R. A simulation means that we can determine what is the `truth' in a
hypothetical population, and then use the computer to draw samples from
this population\footnote{The code here utilizes the Monte Carlo method,
  which essentially is a computational way to see how samples perform
  under realistic data conditions with a known probability distribution.}
to see how sampling (and sample sizes) work. Our quantity of interest is
the proportion of people who like durian. We define the population such
that 65\% of people (in our population) like durian (i.e.,
\(\Pr(\text{Likes Durian}) = 0.65\))\footnote{Look at Chapter
  \ref{ooptech} for a short explanation of how we went from proportions
  to probabilites}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Determine the sample size }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.61
\end{verbatim}

The number produced above is 0.61, but if you run the code above
multiple times, you will realize the number produced is different each
time you run it (i.e., each time you draw a new sample). This makes
sense, since samples are drawn randomly. Since we know the true value of
\(\Pr(\text{Likes Durian})\), we also know how far off these sample
estimates of \(\Pr(\text{Likes Durian})\) tend to be. The next step in
this exercise is to draw a large number of samples of the same size to
show how much these sample proportions can vary.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{bookdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}

You can see that the distribution of proportions from these samples
looks (somewhat) like a bell curve\footnote{Or, in statistics speak, it
  is approximately normally distributed. This will remind you of the
  Central Limit Theorem, if you're familiar.}. Let's now summarize this
distribution with some numbers.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Get the mean of all proportions, }
\CommentTok{#  rounded to 2 decimal places}
\KeywordTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{unlist}\NormalTok{(proportions)),}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.65

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##  2.5% 97.5% 
##  0.56  0.74
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{What do these numbers tell us?} If you realize, the mean of the
distribution of sample proportions is, in fact, the true value of
\(\Pr(\text{Likes Durian})\). This demonstrates that even with
relatively small samples, it is possible to recover the true population
value through repeated sampling. The only difficulty is that we can
seldom get so many samples, so the quantile values are of more help. The
quantile values tell us that 95\% of all the sample proportions will
fall between 0.57 and 0.74. This gives us some measure of uncertainty.
In other words - if I take a single sample of size 100, 95\% of the time
the proportion of those who like durian calculated from this sample will
fall between 0.57 and 0.74 (given that the true value is 0.65)\footnote{Other
  than the sample size, uncertainty also increases if the true value of
  \(\Pr(\text{Likes Durian})\) is closer to 0.50.}. In other words, for
this particular scenario (i.e., 100 observations, true proportion =
0.65), sample estimates will differ from the true value by at most 9
percentage points 95\% of the time. This is the fundamental basis of
claims by researchers that a survey has a certain ``margin of error''.

\textbf{So what happens when we increase the sample size?} Let us run
the same code again, but increase the sample size to 1000.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Determine the sample size}
\NormalTok{n <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1000}

\NormalTok{proportions <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lapply}\NormalTok{(samples, }\ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(x) }\KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(x)}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{n)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##  2.5% 97.5% 
## 0.620 0.679
\end{verbatim}

You will realize here that the interval for the quantile values have
narrowed\footnote{If you calculate the mean of proportions again, you
  will also realize also that it recovers the true value of 0.65}. This
shows that with a bigger sample size, our uncertainty around the true
estimate also shrinks.

Our little simulation exercise has shown a number of things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The basic intuition is correct - larger sample sizes in fact produce
  estimates that are less susceptible to sampling error (that is,
  estimates generally fall closer to the true value).
\item
  However, this basic intuition matters less than we often think. Even a
  relatively small sample size of 1000 (as asserted by the commentator
  in Chapter \ref{sample-worklife}) produces estimates quite close to
  the true value (in this case, within 3 percentage points 95\% of the
  time).
\end{enumerate}

What is important here, however, is that these estimates can only be
calculated in this manner if we have a probability sample - that is, if
we know the sampling probabilites for each respondent in the
sample\footnote{The easiest way is to get a simple random sample (where
  everyone has an equal chance of selection), but there are also ways to
  adjust for more complex cases (e.g., multistage sampling)}. \textbf{If
we do not know how respondents in a sample were recruited, there is no
way to determine whether purported findings actually reflect the
population, and how much uncertainty there is around them}.

This is not to say that there is no way to calculate a ``margin of
error'' or bounds of uncertainty for non-probability samples.
Researchers have been developing new and innovative ways to recover
reliable estimates even with non-probability samples, as ``big data''
comes to the forefront. Unfortunately, people are often careless and
apply methods meant for probability samples to non-probability samples,
expecting them to work in the same way. We will explore this in the next
section.

\section{Non-probability sample, now
what}\label{non-probability-sample-now-what}

Probability samples are hard to come by, and while in theory they are
the ``gold standard''\footnote{Apart from having information on the
  entire population, through a census or administrative government data.},
there are a number of drawbacks when trying to implement them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Poor response rates. Not all respondents in your probability sample
  will agree to respond to your survey or participate in your study.
  While researchers have tried various methods (e.g., offering a
  monetary ``token of appreciation'') to increase response rates, low
  response rates threaten the validity of a probability sample,
  especially if those who refuse are systematically different from those
  who eventually participate.
\item
  High cost. Partly because of strategies to increase response rates
  through ``tokens of appreciation'', the cost of implementing a
  high-quality survey (especially through traditional face-to-face
  interviews) with a probability sample have increased substantially.
\end{enumerate}

Some researchers, therefore, have turned to online surveys (which are
much cheaper to conduct).
\href{https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/gia-documents/cars_-condos-and-cai-png-survey-(high-res).pdf}{One
recent study commissioned by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy}
on Singaporeans' perception of class markers did this.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/samples/today_classpercept} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of TODAYonline article on class perceptions. Retrieved July 16, 2019.}\label{fig:today-classmarkers}
\end{figure}

The newspaper article reports the following:

\begin{quote}
While Dr Dodgson acknowledged that the sample size was relatively low,
with a 4.25 per cent margin of error, she told TODAY that the open-ended
nature of the survey ``gave greater nuance and accuracy'' than
multiple-choice questionnaires.
\end{quote}

\href{https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/gia-documents/cars_-condos-and-cai-png-survey-(high-res).pdf}{The
study report} also contains the following `infographic', which confirms
what the news article reported.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/samples/lkyspp_reportsample} 

}

\caption{Screenshot of TODAYonline article on class perceptions. Retrieved July 16, 2019.}\label{fig:today-reportsample}
\end{figure}

As you may recognize, this ``margin of error'' is something we had
talked about in the previous section. I simulated the results to show
the basic reasoning behind sampling theory, but you can in fact easily
find online calculators purporting to calculate this ``margin of error''
for you\footnote{These calculators use closed-form formulas to produce a
  `margin of error', rather than through the more
  numerical/computational approach I used.}. Let's use a
\href{http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html}{random one I found}. Just
change the margin of error to 4.25 and the population size to
\textasciitilde{}3.5 million (Singapore resident population size) and
you get back a recommended sample size of \textasciitilde{}530\footnote{The
  report itself does not state how they calculated the margin of error.
  It is my guess that this (or a variant of this calculation) is what
  they did. If you are aware that a different method was used, please
  write to me so I can correct it.}. But remember, \textbf{these
calculations are for a probability sample!}\footnote{More specifically,
  a simple random sample.}

Is the study in question conducted with a probability sample? The
details provided are rather vague\footnote{For instance, how did the
  panel responses service recruit participants?}, but my general sense
is that they were not using a probability sample. The report states
that:

\begin{quote}
Responses were solicited via social media and via a panel responses
service. The goal with this was to attract a mixture of opinions, both
from people with a pre-existing interest in the topic (whose opinions
are generally weighted more heavily in political discussion, simply
because they are more likely to assert them and eventually to take
action on the same basis) and from those with no immediate interest
(whose opinions are often discounted in political discussion, but which
can have startling effects at the ballot box). Similarly, the
demographics of the respondents were tracked with the aim of creating a
sample that would be broadly representative of the general population.
\end{quote}

In what seems like implicit acknowledgement that the study did not use a
probability sample, some effort has been made to ensure adequate
`representation' through varied modes (social media and panel responses
service), and through mimicking the country's demographic composition
(probably by ensuring sufficient numbers of minorities)\footnote{This
  appears similar to quota sampling, which is a non-probability sampling
  method.}. It is worth noting, however, that in no way does this make
it equivalent to a probability sample of \emph{all
Singaporeans}\footnote{If only it were that simple.}. \textbf{It is
therefore inappropriate to calculate and use a margin of error \emph{as
if} it were a probability sample of all Singaporeans.}

This does not mean that there is no way to use a non-probability sample
to produce accurate estimates. But methods to derive estimates from
non-probability samples are often context dependent (i.e., they have to
be customized for each case, depending on the quantity of interest) and
have different requirements beyond sample size. It requires more effort
from researchers, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Because of
the practical drawbacks of probability sampling (highlighted above),
statistical innovation to draw inferences from non-probability samples
(often done through post-sampling adjustments) is much needed in the
world of research.

`Big data' plays an important role here. (Matthew Salganik gives one of
the best overviews on the characteristics of `big data'
\href{https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/characteristics/}{in
his book \emph{Bit by Bit}}, which I highly recommend). Data that is
collected constantly and from many people at once allows for timely and
cost-effective results, if we use the right approach to analyze them.
\citet{wang_forecasting_2015} (available
\href{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf}{here})
use multilevel regression and poststratification (affectionately called
``Mister P'') to show that accurate forecasts of the 2012 US
presidential election could be obtained using data from Xbox\footnote{A
  gaming platform} users. Two points are of note here. First, the sample
was large - 750,148 interviews were conducted through Xbox polls, with
345,858 unique respondents, and over 30,000 respondents completed five
or more polls. Second, having strong covariates\footnote{Other
  characteristics of the sample, beyond basic demographic information.}
to adjust for non-response bias (\citet{gelman_mythical_2016}, available
\href{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/swingers.pdf}{here})
and subgroup level characteristics (if more granular subgroup level
estimates are of interest) are crucial to good estimation\footnote{See

\textbf{Neither of these was true in the study by the Lee Kuan Yew
School of Public Policy discussed above.} Of course, this does not mean
\emph{all} of the claims in that study are invalid. There are probably
still insights worth learning from. However, it does tell us that we
need to constantly evaluate the claims of studies against their
methodology - understanding the \emph{how} is often key.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-2}

We have discussed sampling - what probability samples and
non-probability samples are. It is true that sample size matters, but we
can quantify the uncertainty in smaller samples by calculating
bounds/intervals around our estimates. This is quite simple to do if we
have a probability sample, and in such cases, estimates are quite
accurate even with a relatively small sample size (e.g., 1000
observations).

In many studies reported in the media, however, non-probability samples
are used. Non-probability samples can be a good alternative to
probability samples especially given that non-response rates are
increasing. \textbf{However, we cannot use formulas meant for
probability samples and apply them to non-probability samples as if they
are the same.} Non-probability samples require different (and slighty
more complex) methods to produce equally accurate estimates.

What does this case study highlight? First, we need to be
transparent\footnote{And we need to demand transparency.} about how
studies recruit members into their sample. \textbf{How the sample is
recruited is usually much more important than how large the sample is},
but we are seldom given enough detail about it. Second, we need to be
aware if appropriate methods are being used. Using a non-probability
sample can seem more practical, but we become overconfident and may end
up with the wrong conclusions if we simply act as if it is a probability
sample.
