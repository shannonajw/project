<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Declines in marriage and divorce</h2>
<p>Marriage has been a key preoccupation of Singapore society for many reasons (e.g., getting housing, increasing fertility rates). Trends in marriage/divorce/fertility are thus often closely watched. The Straits Times recently published this article on marriage/divorce rates in 2018.</p>

Figure 7.1: Screenshot of online article on marriage rates. Retrieved September 17, 2019.
</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>The article is based on <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/population/smd2018.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> on Marriages and Divorces, produced by the Department of Statistics<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>. Among other things, the article states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A total of 27,007 marriages were registered last year - the lowest in five years and 4.3 per cent fewer than the 28,212 marriages registered in 2017.</p>
<p>… Meanwhile, 7,344 marriages ended in a divorce or annulment last year, a 3.1 per cent drop from the 7,578 marital dissolutions in 2017.</p>
<p>… Given the volatile economy, observers said financial considerations could have contributed to the falling number of marriages and divorces last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, given that we’ve talked about age, cohort, and period changes, one question that should come to mind is: <em>what kind of measure is this?</em> Quite obviously, this is a period measure - it records the number of marriages in a certain year. Unnamed ‘observers’ cited by the article seem to understand this. They point out that the economy last year may have had a part to play, which is a plausible reason for period changes that suits the nature of the measure<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>. We then move on to the following paragraph on changes in median age at first marriage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The median age at first marriage for grooms rose from 29.8 years in 2008 to 30.2 years last year, while for brides, it went up from 27.3 years in 2008 to 28.5 years last year.</p>
<p>This is because more people spend a longer time getting an education and building up their careers before they settle down, said National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Note here that median age at marriage is also a <em>period measure</em> - of all people who got married that year, half of them got married before age 28.5. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser says that the median age at first marriage is rising because “people” spend more time in education and early-career building before they “settle down” (i.e., get married). Who are these “people”, exactly? Since most members of older cohorts do not usually go back into education and early-career building, there seems to be an implicit reference to younger cohorts (or, in layman terms, <em>“people nowadays”</em>)<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>How reasonable is it to adopt <em>cohort</em> explanations for changes in <em>period</em> measures of marriage?</strong> Frustratingly, marriage statistics by cohort are not available from the government. The reason why period measures are used is often a matter of practicality (as we will discuss in the next section), but in other countries, academics use longitudinal panel survey data to estimate and project what might happen in younger cohorts. In Singapore, such survey data is scant and/or tend not to be shared with researchers outside of the government. This makes cohort change especially difficult to study.</p>
<p>But we will work with what we have. For a start, let us try to address one possible concern - that changes in period measures are due to the changing population age structure. Age-specific marriage rates are adjusted for the size of age groups, and therefore may be helpful here. Let’s look back to <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/population/smd2018.pdf" target="_blank">the report</a> on Marriages and Divorces by the Department of Statistics, where we find Figure <a href="marriage-decline.html#fig:apc-reportsingstat">7.2</a>.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As highlighted by the report, it does seem like people are getting married at later ages (generally, you can see that the mountain-like shape in the figure is moving to the right). While we don’t have cohort measures, maybe looking at a mix of period-based and age-based measures provides us some indication as to whether the cohort explanation being offered is a plausible one<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>? Perhaps younger cohorts <em>are</em> delaying marriage in view of education and career building. But even using a mix of period-based and age-based measures might lead to misleading conclusions about cohort change, as we will see shortly.</p>
<p>Let us now move on to another comment that was made. The news article states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Singapore Management University professor of sociology (practice) Paulin Straughan said they also seem to be spending a longer time looking for the right partner. She said: “People believe that marriage is forever and unless they are very sure they have found a life partner, they wouldn’t marry.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>SMU Professor (Practice) Paulin Straughan surmises that median age at first marriage is rising because “people” wait to be very sure of their partner. While there may be some kernel of truth here (although no data is provided to support her point), it is quite unclear what she really means by this. Is she saying that everyone is delaying marriage because Singaporean culture has changed over time and people across all generations are now more careful about who to marry compared to the past<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> (i.e., a period effect)? Or is she saying that younger cohorts are now more careful about who to marry<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> (i.e. a cohort effect)?</p>
<p>Regardless of what you think it may be, a natural follow-up question would be - does this also explain the reason why divorce rates are falling? If the ‘waiting to be very sure’ explanation holds weight, it should follow that since people have become more careful to marry, marriages are probably less likely to end up in divorce<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a>. People “waiting longer” would then be a simple explanation for both falling marriage and divorce rates! Suppose we adopt this explanation for falling divorce rates.</p>
<p>Remember that the divorce numbers mentioned in the news article are a <strong>period</strong> measure<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a>. Once again, we look at age-specific rates to determine if the explanation is plausible (Figure <a href="marriage-decline.html#fig:apc-reportsingstat2nd">7.3</a>).</p>
<br>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:apc-reportsingstat2nd"></span>

<p><br></p>
<p>Indeed, it seems like people are getting divorced at older ages compared to 2008. Divorce numbers thus do not seem to be driven by changes in population age composition. This is the same situation as before (with marriage numbers) - perhaps we can use a mix of period-based and age-based measures to support a cohort interpretation. But how well does this explanation really cohere with true <em>cohort</em> trends?</p>
<p>Data on divorce trends by birth cohort are, once again, not available from the government. Weirdly enough, however, there seems to be some information on divorce by “marriage cohorts” (where each cohort is defined by the year they got married - i.e., if you got married in the same year as I did, you are in my marriage cohort) in a report by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (found <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/research-and-data/Research-and-Data-Series/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>). What kind of change marriage cohort trends really capture is quite hard to say, but for heuristic purposes we will assume they roughly approximate<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> birth cohort trends. Figure <a href="marriage-decline.html#fig:apc-reportmsf">7.4</a> shows us the proportion of divorces (y-axis) that happen before the couples’ <span class="math inline">\(x^{th}\)</span> anniversary (shown on the x-axis), by marriage cohort (indicated by the color and shape of the lines).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can be observed here is that <strong>younger (marriage) cohorts seem to be getting divorced earlier</strong><a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>. For instance, you may notice that a higher proportion of those married in 2011 (light pink line) dissolve their unions before their 5th anniversary compared to those married in 2001 (dark pink line) or earlier<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a>. The picture painted here seems more bleak<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> compared to what we expected from period trends (and the news article), which suggested that divorce rates were falling<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a>, or that marriages were becoming more stable as a result of more careful partner selection.</p>
<p>This suggests that <strong>while period measures and cohort measures can sometimes tell similar stories about societal change, there are many times when they do not.</strong> When we say “marriages and divorces are falling”, we need to be clear what the data allows us to say, and what kinds of explanation we give. In the next section, we will look at life expectancy - a highly misunderstood measure in popular discourse.</p>

<li id="fn61"><p>It could also be that <em>even though</em> people are more careful, they still make choices that end up in divorce, but this is somewhat an awkward assumption to make given a plain reading of the comment.<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref61">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn62"><p>You may also ask, since we’re dealing with absolute numbers, isn’t it obvious that if there are less marriages, then there would be less divorces too? This is why absolute numbers are seldom helpful when examining societal change. At a minimum, we should attempt to look for rates that are adjusted for the size of the group at risk.<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref62">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn63"><p>Think about who gets married in a certain year. What kind of people are they composed of? What characteristics do they share? It is hard to say. Other than sharing the same year of marriage, diversity within marriage cohorts is likely to be huge. We can only assume that younger birth cohorts will dominate most of the marriages in later years, but it remains to be seen whether this is accurate.<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref63">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn64"><p>It remains to be seen if lifetime divorce rates will be higher, since we cannot yet observe the full trajectory of union dissolutions for the younger cohorts (or even for older cohorts, since not all of them have disolved their union or passed away).<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref64">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn65"><p>Note that this does not really line up with the 2018 and 2008 measures we were comparing before, but there really is no easy way to do this.<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref65">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn66"><p>Assuming divorce is always a bad thing, which may not always be the case. A rise in divorce rates may possibly reflect changes in power dynamics within couples, with women becoming more independent and more willing to leave abusive situations.<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref66">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn67"><p>Note that the Department of Statistics <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/population/smd2018.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> also has age-specific divorce rates, which seems to tell a similar story as the period trends - that divorce rates are falling among those who are younger (but rising at older ages). This may however simply be a function of delayed marriages in general leading to delayed divorces<a href="marriage-decline.html#fnref67">↩</a></p></li>
