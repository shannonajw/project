# Restricted Data {#restricteddata}

This section contains a list of datasets that are potentially useful for social scientists to analyze, but for which access is restricted. Other than a description of the data (as far as possible), this will also include information on how restrictions may be lifted (i.e., how to gain access). It is hoped that listing them here will promote greater transparency in data sharing.

Send me an email at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg> if you know about a dataset that should be featured in this list but is not included here.

## Retirement and Health Study (RHS) {#rhs}

The RHS is a longitudinal survey of Singapore residentsâ€™ retirement and healthcare needs and how they change over time. It is conducted by the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF). This is a panel study of individuals aged 45 to 85 in 2014, with the same individuals being interviewed once every two years (for ten years, beginning in 2014). The survey includes information on household expenses, employment, health, and financial status. This is a large study with potentially many uses - RHS [purports](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/RHS_FAQ_Booklet.pdf) to have reached out to more than 23,000 participants in the first two rounds of interviews.

More information [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Others/member-pages/retirement-and-health-study-(rhs)). The RHS website does not list any plans to make the dataset publicly available. The RHS study team can be reached at <cpf_rhs@cpf.gov.sg>.
