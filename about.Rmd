# <span style="color:#436396">About Shannon</span>
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Michigan, with research interests in the health and social lives of older adults. My work so far has focused on the social support and social participation of older adults in Singapore, a rapidly aging city-state in Southeast Asia. Findings from these studies have been published in notable academic journals such as *Social Science and Medicine*, *Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological and Social Sciences*, *Journal of Aging and Health*, and *Aging and Mental Health*, amongst others. I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in collaborative research projects.

My work has been featured in both Singapore and foreign media. I am happy to take queries about issues pertaining to my areas of study.

- [This article](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/support-the-elderly-socially-but-let-them-control-their-lives) in The Straits Times (5 March 2016) was based on [this study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.02.019) published in *Social Science and Medicine*, which found that providing older adults with excessive social support may lead to a reduction in personal mastery.

- [This article](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rather-than-a-helping-hand-offer-caregivers-a-listening-ear) in The Straits Times (3 July 2017) was based on [this study](https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2017.1317329) published in *Aging and Mental Health* that highlighted how working caregivers benefit more from expressive social support, rather than instrumental social support.
