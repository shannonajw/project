This online book is a compilation of resources aimed at advancing quantitative social science in Singapore. It is meant to be a 'living document', so it will be updated as frequently as possible. The main goal is to promote interest, rigour, and transparency in trying to understand Singapore society through quantitative lenses. It does so by: 

1. **Providing information on Singapore-relevant datasets** that are currently used to answer research and policy questions (Chapter \@ref(publicdata) and Chapter \@ref(restricteddata)). This includes: 
    + Descriptions of *publicly available* datasets and how to access them. This overview of the 'data landscape' will be helpful for social scientists to get started with research on Singapore, and prevent wasteful overlap in primary data collection across institutions.
    + A list of *restricted* or *non-publicly available* datasets that could be used to answer important research or policy questions if access was granted. If available, details on the dataset and reasons for data restriction will also be listed. It is hoped that this list will promote greater transparency in data sharing across research teams. 
    
2. **Occasional think pieces by researchers** on best practices and on how to improve quantitative social science in Singapore (Chapter \@ref(think)).
3. **Maintaining a repository of replicable case studies on Singapore society** (with annotated code, where possible) which can be used for illustrations in any quantitatively oriented college-level class (Chapter \@ref(oop) onwards). These may be short summaries (blog-length) of published work, or side analyses that may not be appropriate for an academic journal but are useful for Singapore social science nonetheless.

Readers with ideas on how to improve this resource (or who may wish to help me maintain it) may use the in-built annotation feature, or email me at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg>.

## Why I started this project {-}

Quantitative research is not (and should not be) the only approach we take to understanding Singapore society, but constant appeals to "big data"^[See, for instance, https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/business-big-data-singapore-has-built-cutting-edge] or claims of "evidence-based policy"^[Government agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development often [use such a phrase.](https://www.msf.gov.sg/about-MSF/our-people/Divisions-at-MSF/Family-Development-and-Support/Pages/default.aspx)] makes it ever more important for members of the public to **critically evaluate the use of numbers** in making arguments or in representations of social phenomena.

Educational institutions have an important role to play in this "data-driven" world. Every year, undergraduates studying the social sciences in our local universities take several courses in research methods to fulfil the requirements of their degrees. Part of this research methods sequence typically involves training in introductory statistics or "quantitative reasoning". Quantitative courses in social science departments differ from those taught in the natural sciences because they are thought to be more applied - the focus is on the use of statistical methods to answer questions about society. Understanding and applying these methods **to the Singapore context** is crucial here - at this point, students learn about (and hopefully are inspired by) the kind of questions they can ask about the very society they live in, given the quantitative tools they are learning.

However, my first exposure to statistics as an undergraduate reading Sociology at NUS^[(the) National University of Singapore] was to textbooks containing examples from only Western societies [e.g., @agresti_statistical_2009; @treiman_quantitative_2009]. While the use of these internationally-recognized textbooks may provide some assurance of quality education, sole reliance on foreign material often becomes a missed opportunity to inspire students to build on and improve Singapore social science. Without contextualization^[Notwithstanding the terribly unhelpful stereotype of social science students being "good at writing but bad at numbers".], abstract statistical concepts (e.g., hypotheses testing, chi-squared tests) seem removed from everyday experience, and impede the ability to take these important concepts beyond the classroom and into public dialogue.

I started this book with the view to use it primarily *as a teaching tool*^[For instance, the public repository of Singapore-oriented examples and illustrations may be used to supplement courses based on textbooks written by international scholars.], but it can be used in many other ways. In the long term, I hope that resources in this book will encourage quantitative literacy and research in Singapore by making it easier for interested parties to browse, use, and understand Singapore-relevant data. Social science researchers may use the dataset listings as a springboard for collaboration, or contribute their own interesting case studies for the benefit of the Singapore public. Others (such as journalists, civil servants, or non-profit organizations) may find value in these material as a gateway to quantitative research on Singapore society, and how to think carefully about pertinent issues surrounding such work.

## How to contribute {-}

**To list a dataset**

I will list any Singapore-related dataset that I know of, but my knowledge is far from exhaustive. To help me out, you can simply alert me to an unlisted dataset and let me know where to find information on it (and I will write it up). However, if you could do the following and send it to me, it would make my task much easier:

Write a short paragraph on the dataset which includes (but is not limited to) the following information:

* Basic details about the dataset (name, how was data collected, how many observations etc.)
* Name(s) of the Principal Investigator(s) (and links to their webpage/profiles, if possible)
* How to access the dataset (e.g., a website that allows a direct download or lists instructions to obtain the data)

*Publicly available* datasets are basically datasets that can be downloaded freely or for which access can obtained through a simple procedure (e.g., signing up for on online account, sending a form with a research topic). *Restricted* or *Non-publicly available* datasets are those that require more extensive clearance (e.g., a background check, use of a data enclave) to access. Data for which there is no information on access also fall under this criteria. Email me at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg> to list a dataset.

**To write a think piece**

Think pieces can be of any length (suggested length is 500-2000 words) and on any topic related to quantitative social science. For instance, pieces may comment on the state of quantitative social science in Singapore (e.g., what is lacking, how we can do better) and/or provide tips for social scientists seeking to study Singapore (e.g., how to write grant applications, where to find data). That said, I am still mulling over whether this should be an invite-only section, or have pieces go through some kind of review mechanism (I do not wish to be the sole arbiter of what goes up here). Nevertheless, email me at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg> if you think you can contribute a think piece (or have someone to suggest).

<br>

**To contribute a case study**

Case studies are meant to illustrate a point about Singapore as a society or quantitative methods in general. These may include blog-length summaries of published research, or smaller side analyses that are useful for Singapore social science. I am hoping that these case studies will be replicable (i.e., anyone familiar with some code^[Code can be in any language - R, Stata, Python, SAS, Mplus etc.] can reproduce results), but researchers unable to share code (and data) should not disqualify themselves from contributing. Further, this online book is written using the Rmarkdown language, so it would be helpful if contributors are familiar with it - but this is not a prerequisite. Email me at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg> if you have an idea for a case study, and we can work together to make it happen.
