# Preface {-}

This online book is a compilation of resources aimed at advancing quantitative social science in Singapore. It is meant to be a 'living document', so it will be updated as frequently as possible. The main goal is to promote interest, rigour, and transparency in trying to understand Singapore society quantitatively. It does so by: 

1. **Providing information on Singapore-relevant datasets** that are currently used to answer research and policy questions (Chapter \@ref(publicdata) and Chapter \@ref(restricteddata)). This includes: 
    + Descriptions of *publicly available* datasets and how to access them. This overview of the 'data landscape' will be helpful for social scientists to get started with research on Singapore, and prevent wasteful overlap in primary data collection across institutions.
    + A list of *restricted* or *non-publicly available* datasets that could be used to answer important research or policy questions if access was granted. If available, details on the dataset and reasons for data restriction will also be listed. It is hoped that this list will promote greater transparency in data sharing across research teams. 
    
2. **Maintaining a repository of replicable case studies on Singapore society** (with annotated code, where possible) which can be used for illustrations in any quantitatively oriented college-level class (Chapter \@ref(races) to Chapter \@ref(lifecourse)). These may be short summaries (blog-length) of published work, or side analyses that may not be appropriate for an academic journal but are useful for Singapore social science nonetheless.
3. **Occasional think pieces by researchers** on best practices and on how to improve quantitative social science in Singapore (Chapter \@ref(think)).

Quantitative research is not (and should not be) the only approach we take to understanding Singapore society, but constant appeals to "big data"^[See, for instance, https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/business-big-data-singapore-has-built-cutting-edge] or claims of "evidence-based policy"^[Government agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development often [use such a phrase.](https://www.msf.gov.sg/about-MSF/our-people/Divisions-at-MSF/Family-Development-and-Support/Pages/default.aspx)] makes it ever more important for members of the public to **critically evaluate the use of numbers** in making arguments or in representations of social phenomena. 

Educational institutions have an important role to play in this "data-driven" world. Every year, undergraduates studying the social sciences in our local universities take several courses in research methods to fulfil the requirements of their degrees. Part of this research methods sequence typically involves training in introductory statistics or "quantitative reasoning". Quantitative courses in social science departments differ from those taught in the natural sciences because they are thought to be more applied - the focus is on the use of statistical methods to answer questions about society. Understanding and applying these methods *to the Singapore context* is crucial here - at this point, students learn about (and hopefully are inspired by) the kind of questions they can ask about the very society they live in, given the quantitative tools they are learning.

However, my first exposure to statistics as an undergraduate reading Sociology at NUS^[(the) National University of Singapore] was to textbooks containing examples only from Western societies [e.g., @agresti_statistical_2009; @treiman_quantitative_2009]. While the use of these internationally-recognized textbooks may provide some assurance of quality education, sole reliance on foreign material often becomes a missed opportunity to inspire students to build on and improve Singapore social science. Without contextualization^[Notwithstanding the terribly unhelpful stereotype of social science students being "good at writing but bad at numbers".], abstract statistical concepts (e.g., hypotheses testing, chi-squared tests) seem removed from everyday experience, and impede the ability to take these important concepts beyond the classroom and into public dialogue.

I started this book with the view to use it primarily *as a teaching tool*^[For instance, the public repository of Singapore-oriented examples and illustrations may be used to supplement courses based on textbooks written by international scholars.], but it can be used in many other ways. It is hoped that in the long term, resources in this book will encourage quantitative literacy and research in Singapore by making it easier for interested parties to browse and use with Singapore-relevant data. Social science researchers may use the dataset listings as a springboard for collaboration, or present their own interesting case studies for the benefit of the Singapore public. Others (such as journalists, civil servants, or non-profit organizations) may find value in these material as a gateway to quantitative research on Singapore society, and how to think about pertinent issues surrounding such work.
