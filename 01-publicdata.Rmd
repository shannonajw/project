# (PART) Datasets for Social Science {-}

# Public Data {#publicdata}

This section contains a list of public datasets available for social scientists to analyze. Datasets should be in disaggregated form that is useful for academic work and social research. For each one, a brief description of the dataset, the investigators, and details for access will be included. It is expected that this list will continue to grow. 

Aggregated administrative data, like those that can be found on <https://data.gov.sg> or from government reports, are not the focus here. However, information on data that can be linked to disaggregated datasets (e.g., data on neighbourhood characteristics) are much welcomed. 

Send me an email at <shannon.ang@ntu.edu.sg> if you know about a dataset that should be featured in this list but is not included here.

## World Values Survey (WVS) {#wvs}

The World Values Survey is a study to help social scientists understand changes in the beliefs, values and motivations of people throughout the world. To date, there have been 7 waves of data collection (repeated cross-section, not panel). The survey includes questions on societal trust, religion, work, security, and politics. Singapore participated in Wave 4 (2002, N=1512) and Wave 6 (2012, N=1972). Principal Investigators for these studies are Associate Professor [Tan Ern Ser](http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/soctanes/) at NUS, and Associate Professor [Vincent CH Chua](https://www.suss.edu.sg/about-suss/faculty-and-staff/detail/vincent-chua) at SUSS (2012).
